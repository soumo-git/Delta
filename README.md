# Project Delta 🚀

Welcome to **Project Delta** — the kind of app combo that makes tech bros sweat, parents clap, and children cry softly into their pillows at night. 😅

Delta is a **two-headed beast** 🐉:

- 📱 **Child App**: A stealthy Android shadow that streams video, obeys commands, and disappears into the OS like a ninja. It survives reboots, icon hides, and your kid’s desperate “I’ll just uninstall it” tantrums. Good luck, little Timmy. 👀
- 🖥️ **Parent App**: Once an Android mess, then reborn into a glorious **Electron desktop overlord**. It connects through Firebase, tames WebRTC, and delivers the sweet power of camera control, microphone snooping, and stealth toggling—all at the click of a button. A true panopticon, but with better UI. ✨

## Origin Story 🧭

This wasn’t coded in some corporate dungeon. No. 👎
This was built by a so-called *“non-coder”* armed with stubbornness, a search bar, and enough caffeine to rewrite half the internet. ☕️

From the ashes of:

- 💥 Android’s cursed `SurfaceViewRenderer` drama
- 🔌 Firebase signaling headaches
- 🧨 TURN server betrayals (Twilio, we see you later 👀)
- ⚔️ And the eternal war between React and vanilla JS

…rose a project where **a single person built both sides of a parental control empire.** 🛠️

Yes. By hand. By guts. By pure audacity. 😤

## Features ✨

- 🕵️‍♂️ **Stealth Mode**: The Child App literally deletes its own icon and laughs at the idea of “visibility.” Once gone, it stays gone until parent wants to show up.
- 📹 **Video Streaming**: Parents get live video feeds of what the kid’s up to. (Spoiler: it’s usually TikTok, Instagram, or staring blankly at a wall.)
- 🎤 **Mic Streaming**: Live mic feed to parent for live audio monetoring. Just listen and chill, baby.
- 🛰️ **Location Monitoring**: Just hit on the start button and you'll get live location.
- 📩 **SMS Monitoring**: You can see all previous sms and all upcoming sms live.
- 📞 **Call Monitoring**: All call logs in your parent's dashboard. (Call recording coming soon ☠️)
- 💬 **Chat Monitoring**: All social media chats in parent's hand - Privacy left the chat. (Working on it, but you can see the chat's - Just open the devoloper tools in ParentElectron app.)
- 🔄 **Persistence**: Reboots? App restarts? The Child App just shrugs. Try harder, kid.
- 🌑 **Dark Dashboard Vibes**: The Parent App is wrapped in a clean, scalable Electron UI—complete with cosmic particles swirling in the background. Because if you’re spying, might as well look cool.

## Closing Words ✍️

Project Delta is not just an app. It’s a statement:
that with enough stubbornness, curiosity, and questionable morality, you can bend tech into whatever shape you want.

- Children of the world, beware. ⚠️
- Parents of the world, rejoice. 🎉
- Developers of the world… maybe start updating your résumés. 📄
- And creeps, you already know what to do. 🙂
